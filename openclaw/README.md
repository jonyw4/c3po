# OpenClaw config (examples)

- `openclaw/openclaw.json5.example` is a JSON5 example to base your `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` on (do not commit the real file).
- `openclaw/openclaw.json5.local` is generated by `bun scripts/render-files.ts` using paths and allowlists from your `config/people.json`.
- WhatsApp login/authentication is typically done via the OpenClaw flow and saved in `~/.openclaw/` (outside the workspace).
- To allow the agent to create Google Calendar events securely, use Exec Approvals with allowlist (see `openclaw/exec-approvals.json.example`) and only allow the wrappers `scripts/c3po-calendar.ts` and `scripts/c3po-calendar-create`.
